## üéØ Current Status:

If you are interested in or curious, can reach out to any one of the maintainers. We will be glad to hear from you.

Also, you can see the prototype of the design we are trying to implement @ [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/nh07hNmvvqOjgArwMWyLri/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=HZVfwJ4puuCq71sY-0)
